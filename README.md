##React Hooks:
* useState
  * This hook is used to update/state the initial/entered variable.

* useReducer
  * An alternative to useState.
  * usually preferable to useState when you have complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one.
  * lets you optimize performance for components that trigger deep updates because you can pass dispatch down instead of callbacks.

* useEffect
  * The function passed to useEffect will run after the render is committed to the screen. Think of effects as an escape hatch from Reactâ€™s purely functional world into the imperative world.
  * Effects run after every completed render, but you can choose to fire them only when certain values have changed.
  * The clean-up function
     * Runs before the component is removed from the UI to prevent memory leaks. Additionally, if a component renders multiple times (as they typically do), the previous effect is cleaned up before executing the next effect.


* useContext
* useRef
* useMemo
* useCallback
